Excercise 3:
Assuming that the following JOS kernel code is correct, what type should variable x have, uintptr_t or physaddr_t?
uintptr_t

Exercise 5:
a) 
b) If the page table or page directory entry for a page of virtual memory does not have the user permission bit set (PTE_U), then the MMU will throw an exception if an attempt is made to read or write to them when the processor is running in user mode. I have not set the user bit for the page table entries associated with virtual addresses:
-[pages, ROUNDUP(npages * sizeof(struct PageInfo)) (writable page free list)
-[KSTACKTOP-KSTKSIZE, KSTACKTOP] (Kernel stack)
-[KERNBASE, 2^32] (Kernel code)
So the MMU will fault if the processor is in user mode and tries to access the virtual addresses in these regions
c) The virtual address space goes from [0,2**32), so the maximum amount of memory that could be supported is 2**32 (4GB).
d) We would have (2**32 / 4096 = 1048576) pages, and since each PageInfo struct is 6 bytes, 1048576 * 6 = 6291456 bytes of overhead
e)
